They're debugging artifacts that should be removed before deployment. Accidentally shipping console logs can leak business logic, data structures, or user information.

**🧙 Wizard's Note:** If your code uses an app attribute flag to enable/disable logging based on environments, you may think you don't need this rule. However, my recommendation would be to keep the rule in place and use it as a reminder to quickly verify any logging in place and ensure that those statements are implemented using your attribute flags. If a log entry slips in that didn't use it, this means your code may unintentionally write to production logs, leading to the kind of PII leakage that the rule is intended to help avoid!''',
