They're also harder to get wrong since you don't manage the loop index yourself. Modern array methods make code more readable and reduce bugs related to loop boundaries or index manipulation.''',

```javascript
const results = [];
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {  // ❌ Manual loop
    if (items[i].active) {
        results.add(items[i].name);
    }

**Fix:**

```javascript
