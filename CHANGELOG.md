## [v1.4.0] - 2025-12-02

### Changed

- **Configuration UI Refactoring** - Split large CSS files into feature-specific modules and extracted configuration logic into dedicated JavaScript modules.
- **Light Mode Polish** - Enhanced visual depth, shadows, and hover effects for Grimoire cards and modal interfaces.
- **Modal Ergonomics** - Optimized modal dimensions with shrink-wrap behavior and fixed desktop width for consistent experience across screen sizes.
- **Configuration Cards** - Gone are the huge configuration cards, in favor of a less dominant presence.

## [v1.3.0] - 2025-11-11

### Added

- **Version Awareness Everywhere** - Packaging-driven source of truth now surfaces through the `__version__` module, CLI `--version` flag, desktop splash/title, and the web UI badge.
- **Automated Update Detection** - Full update checker stack with FastAPI endpoints, desktop bridge, and web wiring backed by a preferences manager with opt-in, timestamp, and cache fields.
- **In-App Settings Panel** - Hover-expanding settings orb lets users toggle automated update checks without leaving the primary workflow.

### Changed

- **Preferences Schema & Storage** - Atomic writes, schema migrations, and normalized legacy keys safeguard future settings expansions.
- **Frontend Controls & Layout** - Theme toggle restyled as a hover orb with modularized CSS bundles for maintainability and responsiveness.
- **Update Caching Strategy** - Server and desktop health checks reuse GitHub responses for five minutes to respect external rate limits.

### Fixed

- **macOS DMG Detection** - Correctly recognizes mounted volumes, prevents premature exits, and improves relocation guidance.
- **Structure Rule Reliability** - PMD section ordering and string-boolean checks ignore underscore-prefixed (commented) keys, resolving issue #46.
- **Script Rule Accuracy** - Stops flagging top-level constants as unused and consistently detects magic numbers in simple return statements.
- **Manifest Naming Expectations** - AMD/SMD naming enforcement skips platform-generated files and tabbed PMD sections evaluate correctly.
